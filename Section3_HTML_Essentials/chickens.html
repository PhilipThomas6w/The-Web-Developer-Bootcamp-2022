        <h1>Chickens</h1>

        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
            such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for
            an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
            female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>

        <p>Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the
            study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
            period (4th–2nd centuries BC).<sup>[3][4]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
            meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as of 2018,[5] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[6] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.[6] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
            East Asia,[7] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent.</p>

        <p>From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
            BC.[8] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come
            from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[9][10][11]</p>

        <p>In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[12] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken
            is from South-East Asia. This is the area east of India and south of China.</p>
